## Components bundled by Rollup are not able to render in Server components

- [Error]
  . useEffect only works in Client Components. Add the "use client" directive at the top of the file to use it

- [Solution]
  . Add `preamble` to `terser` plugin of `rollup.config.js`

```
    format: {
        preamble: `"use client"`,
    },
```

## Using createPortal for components which is rendered in SSR will prevent rendering HTML tags (not support SEO)

- [Realize]
  . If there are any client code (document.body, etc..) running on server components, it will lead to preventing render HTML tags

- [Solution]
  . Add `use client` at top of components
  . Use `mounted` state

## setUsyTheme is not a function if running in server components
